# Actuator Example

## Description
In this example we will show you how to use Spring Boot actuator to assess the health of your GemFire apps.

Spring Boot actuator allows users to effectively manage and monitor their Spring Boot for VMware GemFire apps in a production environment.

## Prerequisites
In order to run the following example one requires the following to be set up:
* Java 17
* Latest VMware GemFire is installed locally
* Set up local `gradle` or `maven` environment by following Steps 1-6 and 8 from [Spring Boot For VMware GemFire Quickstart](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Spring-Boot-for-VMware-GemFire/index.html#spring-boot-for-vmware-gemfire-quick-start-0)

## Steps to run
1. Clone `Spring For GemFire Examples` project
2. Start GemFire server-side processes
    1. Open new Terminal
    2. `cd` into the `boot/actuator` project directory.
    3. Start `gfsh` located in the `{VMware_GemFire_installation_location}/bin` directory
    4. Launch the Locator and Server by running `start.gfsh` file located in the `actuator` project directory in `gfsh`. <br> e.g `run --file={pathToStartGfshFile}/start.gfsh`
    5. Confirm that the locator and server are running by running `list members` in `gfsh`, which should contain two entries.
3. Start Client
    1. Open a new Terminal
    2. `cd` into the `actuator` project directory
    3. Run `gradle clean bootRun` to run the client


## Expected Outcome

```
HOT TEMPERATURE READING [225 °F]
COLD TEMPERATURE READING [30 °F]
COLD TEMPERATURE READING [0 °F]
Freezing: 2
Boiling: 1
```

## Shut down and Cleanup
Run the following commands to shut down and cleanup:
In the Server Terminal window (assuming `gfsh` is still active):
1. Run `shutdown --include-locators`
2. Exit from the `gfsh` by running `quit`
3. Delete the created directories `example-locator` and `example-server`
